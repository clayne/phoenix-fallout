# Setup

## Getting Started

While Wabbajack takes care of 99% of the work, there are still stome steps that need to be completed by the user. The Setup will take you through the process from start to finish.

## Requirements

- A copy of Fallout 4 with all official DLC (Game of the Year Edition) on Steam.
- A [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4) account, preferrably with a Premium subscription.

Installing the game and Mod Organizer 2 on an SSD is highly recommend to reduce loading times and eliminate stuttering.
