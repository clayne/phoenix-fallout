# Welcome

Phoenix: Fallout is a Wabbajack mod list for Fallout 4 with an emphasis on enhanced gameplay and visuals while staying true to the original game. As a vanilla-plus overhaul for a 2015 game, you can expect improved visuals *and* performance as well as changes to various gameplay mechanics.

What you can expect from Phoenix Fallout:

-  Moderately improved visuals while retaining a high frame rate.
-  Custom file edits and patches for a coherent experience.
-  Detailed instructions for the initial setup as well as ingame configuration.

What you cannot expect from Phoenix Fallout:

- Any type of NSFW content.
- New quest mods.
- Mods that are vastly different from the vanilla experience.

# About Me

Hi there! I'm Phoenix.

Some of you may know me from my Skyrim Special Edition modding guide, The Phoenix Flavour. Unlike TPF, Phoenix Fallout is not a guide but a Wabbajack installer. Both projects are similar in that they are vanilla-plus oriented.

This Wabbajack list is a side-project of mine, based on years of attempting to turn Fallout 4 into the game I would like it to be - just a little better than vanilla. It is worth noting that I have not played previous Fallout games and therefore I have no opinion on them, or how they compare to FO4. Personally, I love FO4 nowhere near as much as I do Skyrim, but it provides another modding playground so here we are.
