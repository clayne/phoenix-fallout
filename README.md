# Welcome

Phoenix: Fallout is a Wabbajack mod list for Fallout 4 with an emphasis on enhanced gameplay and visuals while staying true to the original game. As a vanilla-plus overhaul for a 2015 game, you can expect improved visuals *and* performance as well as changes to various gameplay mechanics.

## Features

-  Moderately improved visuals while retaining a high frame rate.
-  Custom file edits and patches for a coherent experience.
-  VIS-based sorting overhaul with a custom keywords resource.
-  Detailed instructions for the initial setup as well as ingame configuration.

## Not included

- Silent protagonist.
- Survival mode.
- Any type of NSFW content.
- New quest mods.
- Mods that are vastly different from the vanilla experience.

# Hardware Recommendation

While Phoenix: Fallout is made with gameplay in mind, a decent gaming PC is required to run the setup comfortably. This is due to the bad optimisation of the vanilla game as much as the included mods. Keep in mind that the game will perform much better on 1080p than on 1440p (the latter being the resolution I play at).

You can see the details of my setup below.

# About Me

Hi there! I'm Phoenix.

Some of you may know me from my Skyrim Special Edition modding guide, The Phoenix Flavour. Unlike TPF, Phoenix: Fallout is not a guide but a Wabbajack installer. However, both projects are similar in that they are vanilla-plus oriented.

This Wabbajack list is a side-project of mine, based on years of attempting to turn Fallout 4 into the game I would like it to be - just a little better than vanilla. It is worth noting that I have not played previous Fallout games and therefore I have no opinion on them, or on how they compare to FO4. Personally, I love FO4 nowhere near as much as I do Skyrim, but it provides another modding playground so here we are.

# Future Plans

I am planning to build Phoenix: Fallout in three steps:

1. Create a baseline vanilla plus setup. Establish primary systems (item sorting, crafting stations).
2. Expand the settlement building system with new mods and SMM integration.
3. Implement survival mods (Campfire 2.0 when it's out, Canteens of the Commonwealth, potentially [Advanced Needs 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/40440)).
