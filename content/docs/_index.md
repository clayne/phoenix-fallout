Phoenix: Fallout is a Wabbajack mod list for (hey, you guessed it) Fallout 4 with an emphasis on enhanced gameplay and graphics while staying true to the original game. As a vanilla-plus overhaul for a 2015 game, you can expect improved visuals and performance as well as changes to various gameplay mechanics and some new content.

**Unlike The Phoenix Flavour for Skyrim SE, Phoenix: Fallout is not a full guide.** Instructions to build this setup manually are not included. I do not have the time to maintain two modding guides so Phoenix: Fallout will be available exclusively for Wabbajack for the forseeable future.

## What is Wabbajack?

Due to the lack of sharing permissions for the vast majority of mods, traditional mod packs do not exist for Bethesda games such as Fallout 4. With Wabbajack it is possible to replicate a user's mod list and recreate it on another's computer without sharing any of the source files. For more information, please check out the [Wabbajack website](https://www.wabbajack.org/) or join the official [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/wabbajack).

## About Phoenix: Fallout

### Features

-  Moderately improved visuals while retaining a high frame rate.
-  Adventure with Dogmeat and one other companion as originally intended by Bethesda.
-  Custom file edits and patches for a coherent experience.
-  VIS-based sorting overhaul with a custom keywords resource.
-  Simple implementation of crafting stations with support for included mods.
-  Detailed instructions for the initial setup as well as ingame configuration.

### Not included

If you are looking for any of the following features, Phoenix: Fallout may not be the mod list for you:

- Silent protagonist.
- Survival mode.
- Any type of NSFW content.
- New quest mods.
- Mods that are vastly different from the vanilla experience.
- Creation Club support.

### Alternatives

- Looking for hardcore gameplay on Survival difficulty with Horizon? Check out [FO4 Enhanced Edition](https://www.wabbajack.org/modlists/gallery/fallout_4_enhanced_edition).
- Looking to get into the Sim Settlements mod? Install the [Sim Settlements Experience](https://www.wabbajack.org/modlists/gallery/ssem).

## Recommended Hardware

While Phoenix: Fallout was made with gameplay in mind, a decent gaming PC is required to run the setup comfortably. This is due to the bad optimisation of the vanilla game as much as the included mods. Keep in mind that the game will perform much better on 1080p than on 1440p or higher resolutions.

You can see the details of my setup below.
