## Prelude

While Wabbajack takes care of 99% of the work, there are still some steps that need to be completed by the user. The Setup will take you through the process from start to finish and you are expected to follow it to the letter.

None of the instructions here are specific to the Phoenix: Fallout list. Any other Wabbajack list authors are welcome to copy this page, or simply link back here.

## Requirements

- A copy of Fallout 4 with all official DLC (Game of the Year Edition) on Steam.
- A [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4) account, preferrably with a Premium subscription.
- A hard drive (SSD preferred) with at least 100GB of free space.

## Modding Folder

- On a hard drive with plenty of free space (that is not your SSD), create a new folder called **Fallout 4 Modding**.
- Create several more folders inside:
  - `Fallout 4 Modding\Backups\Creation Club`
  - `Fallout 4 Modding\Backups\Executables 1.10.163.0`
  - `Fallout 4 Modding\Wabbajack`

## VC Redists

Mod Organizer 2 requires the latest Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable.

- Open the [official VC Redists page](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) and download the following file:
  - **vc_redist.x64.exe**
- Run downloaded executable. It will guide you through the installation process.
- You may have to restart your computer in order to finalise the installation.
