# Dismemberment Tweaks

### Description

In vanilla, any weapon can sever enemy limbs or cause them to explode. This can be disabled by setting **On Hit** to "No dismember/explode" which is what this plugin does for some weapons. All edited weapons had edits from my Weapon Sorting module forwarded, and the resulting plugin was ESL-ified.

### Credit

The idea and implementation comes from Hoosteen's [Disable Dismemberment by Weapon](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/16541). My plugin covers mostly the same weapons although I kept dismemberment for most heavy weapons and disabled it for some weapons the original mod didn't edit.
